sp-apply
========
Eric Smith's application project.

The project is a simple web project created in Eclipse with a Rest service and a html/jquery web front end. I did not use ant or maven, so the jars are all included in /WEB-INF/lib. 

You can test the project by installing the war file on a tomcat and going to:
